## About

I am a undergraduated student at Department of Computer Science and Engineering, Korea University.
I am currently interning in [Programming Systems Lab](https://prosys.kaist.ac.kr) in KAIST advised by [Kihong Heo](https://kihongheo.kaist.ac.kr).

## Research Interests

My research interests are related to improving of programming system using program analysis, synthesis, verification methods based on programming language theory.
In particular,
- **Program Analysis** for automatically detecting software bugs and vulnerabilies
- **Type Safety** of object-oriented imperative programming languages
- **Program Verification** for automatically reasoning correctmess of program
- Scalable **Program Synthesis** in specific domains
